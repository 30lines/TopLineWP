Helps Create Wordpress Property Management Company and Property tailored portfolio websites.

== Description ==

30lines has developed a WordPress plugin to help create both Property Management Company and Property tailored portfolio websites - that can pull live available and push to a lead integration system via the TopLine Web Service.

The TopLine Wordpress plugin provides you with 'out-of-the-box' templates for your **single** property and floor plan views. These layouts have been optimized to fit into just about any theme and are completely extendable/customizable.

== Installation ==
= Option 1 =
* Install and activate from Wordpress plugin repository after a fresh WP install
= Option 2 =
* Download zip of plugin
* Upload plugin to wordpress site
* Fill out setting information under TopLine admin menu item

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Does the plugin support single AND multi-property websites? =
Yes! If you visit the TopLine settings page in the WP dashboard, you can add as many properties as you want!
= Can I import existing information into TopLine? =
Only if your existing information resides in Entrata. We are currently working on support for RentCafe, and Buildium is next.

* Thanks to [30lines Dev Team](http://30lines.com/) [@30lines](https://twitter.com/30lines) for great help with the first release of a 30lines wordpress plugin!

== Compatability ==
= Genisis Framework =
When using the Genesis framework, be sure to add a child theme and extend the 'single.php' file with 'single-floorplan' and 'single-property' ( if necessary )
If you want to use our flexible default template, you can copy our template file over to the new single files in your child theme.
Also, don't forget to re-save your permalinks after saving your TopLine Settings.
